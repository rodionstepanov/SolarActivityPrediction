# SolarActivityPrediction

### Description

This repository contains data of solar activity forecast. 
Data are obtained using a method based on a combination of the numerical solution of the nonlinear mean-field dynamo equations and the artificial neural network.
The detail can be found in the paper (https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022377818000600, PDF-file  in the `doc/` folder).

### Data format
We update our forecast of 13-months running averaged sunspot numbers at the beginning of each month.
The files `predict_YY_MM.csv`appear in the `data/` folder.

Format: Comma Separated values

Contents:
- Column 1-2: Gregorian calendar  Year-Month
- Column 3: predicted sunspot numbers 

We compare with observational data provided by https://www.sidc.be/silso/datafiles
(`SN_ms_tot_V2.0.csv` is available in the `doc/` folder)

### Specific time intervals

* Forecast data in table form. Each column is for the date of predicted 13-months running average sunspot number (-6 months from the date of the given forecast). Each raw is for the date when the solar activity was predicted
